    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a powerful, open-source, general-purpose programming language with a wide variety of applications. Many [websites and apps](https://codeinstitute.net/blog/7-popular-software-programs-written-in-python/) that we are familiar with, including YouTube, Instagram, Spotify etc, are actually built on Python. In the field of bioinformatics, Python is also widely used in computational programming, data analysis, and pipeline development. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we have listed some examples where Python-based tools are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Example use case** | **Tool** |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| Pipeline development | [bcbio](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) |\n",
    "| Image analysis | [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/) |\n",
    "| Molecular visualization | [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) |\n",
    "| Machine learning | [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) |\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Many bioinformatics tools are written in Python, and you may have encountered/used them without knowing how they work. This is okay, but if you want to customize them or modify something, you will need to understand the scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it was first released in 1991, Python has been constantly developed and updated. The current version of Python is 3.0. Python programming language features include:\n",
    "- Easy-to-understand syntax\n",
    "- Large number of built-in libraries for common tasks\n",
    "- Succinct and readable format, both friendly to the programming amateur and the professional\n",
    "- Widely used programming language, with good documentation and lots of tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will you learn in this workshop?\n",
    "To take this workshop, you don't need to have prior experience in Python (or any other programming language(s)). We will start with basic Python syntax, progress through various concepts and end with learning about writing conditional statements. The workshop is designed to set a foundation for advanced topics in Python, including data wrangling/visualization, pipeline development, and machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional tips\n",
    "- `#` at the beginning of the line denotes that the following statement is a comment or annotation for the code. Essentially, any line starting with a `#` won't be executed by Python. \n",
    "- Indentation is very important in Python syntax. Not only is it necessary for Python, it is great for code readability. Essentially, by making indentations essential, Python forces good code-writing. We will be talking more about this throughout the workshop."
