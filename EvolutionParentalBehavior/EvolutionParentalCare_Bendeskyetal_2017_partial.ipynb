Lewarch, Shenqin Yao, Brant K. Peterson, Meng Xiao He,  Catherine Dulac,  & Hopi E. Hoekstra\n","> *Nature* **2017**\n","\n","> **ABSTRACT:** Parental care is essential for the survival of mammals, yet the mechanisms underlying its evolution remain largely unknown. Here we show that two sister species of mice, Peromyscus polionotus and Peromyscus maniculatus, have large and heritable differences in parental behaviour. Using quantitative genetics, we identify 12 genomic regions that affect parental care, 8 of which have sex-specific effects, suggesting that parental care can evolve independently in males and females. Furthermore, some regions affect parental care broadly, whereas others affect specific behaviours, such as nest building. Of the genes linked to differences in nest-building behaviour, vasopressin is differentially expressed in the hypothalamus of the two species, with increased levels associated with less nest building. Using pharmacology in Peromyscus and chemogenetics in Mus, we show that vasopressin inhibits nest building but not other parental behaviours. Together, our results indicate that variation in an ancient neuropeptide contributes to interspecific differences in parental care."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"1MegNozwwQWm","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":343},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1613697648991,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":419,"user":{"displayName":"Krista Perks","photoUrl":"","userId":"11118389411424303278"}},"outputId":"110cc021-0ad6-484e-d40a-8a14a55643d3"},"source":["# @title Monogomous and Permiscuous voles\n","%%html\n","<div align='center'>\n","  <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15MZd0zThC4KbFyPUau8CoHZNtb6XHPTS' style=\"width: 85vw\"></div>\n","\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<div align='center'>\n","  <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15MZd0zThC4KbFyPUau8CoHZNtb6XHPTS' style=\"width: 85vw\"></div>\n"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7JCDFgU1wFHD"},"source":["### In preparation for this classroom session you read the paper \"*The genetic basis of parental care evolution in monogamous mice*\" as well as the \"News and Views\" commentary \"*How to build a better dad*\" written by Steven Phelps.<br>\n","---\n","# **Today** you will work directly with data from this paper.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4IkKVtHE2UNq","cellView":"form","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1613759347645,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":494,"user":{"displayName":"Krista Perks","photoUrl":"","userId":"11118389411424303278"}}},"source":["#@title __execute__ this cell to prepare your notebook environment with the necessary python packages \n","\n","# and mount your google drive\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import urllib.request\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import matplotlib\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import scipy\n","from IPython.display import display\n","\n","plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 18})\n","\n","# from google.colab import drive\n","# drive.mount('/content/gdrive')\n","\n","def create_figure():\n","  hfig = plt.figure()\n","  ax = hfig.add_axes([0.1,0.1,0.8,0.8])\n","  return ax"],"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wpcSfWv2sdxK"},"source":["---\n","#Before working with the data, let's reflect on some of the important aspects of the experimental design.\n","\n","### Diversity of parental care behavior is widespread in the animal kingdom.
