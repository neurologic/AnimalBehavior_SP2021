Okobi Jr.\\*, Arkarup Banerjee\\*, Andrew M. M. Matheson, Steven M. Phelps, Michael A. Long. \n","> *Science* **2019**\n","\n","> **ABSTRACT:** Like many adaptive behaviors, acoustic communication often requires rapid modification of motor output in response to sensory cues. However, little is known about the sensorimotor transformations that underlie such complex natural behaviors. In this study, we examine vocal exchanges in Alstonâ€™s singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina). We find that males modify singing behavior during social interactions on a subsecond time course that resembles both traditional sensorimotor tasks and conversational speech. We identify an orofacial motor cortical region and, via a series of perturbation experiments, demonstrate a hierarchical control of vocal production, with the motor cortex influencing the pacing of singing behavior on a moment-by-moment basis, enabling precise vocal interactions. These results suggest a systems-level framework for understanding the sensorimotor transformations that underlie natural social interactions."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"BHV1aWuK-o_G","colab_type":"code","cellView":"form","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":268},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1596402123360,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":551,"user":{"displayName":"Krista Perks","photoUrl":"","userId":"11118389411424303278"}},"outputId":"df367b0d-56d5-4d67-d56a-92f90128b922"},"source":["#@title Cartoon of singing neotropical mice; from Okobi & Banerjee et al (2019)\n","%%html\n","<div align=\"center\">\n","  <img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1U52yFSVKvvTwbFi_-phMIR5xYEabNp53' style=\"width: 80vw\"></div>"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<div align=\"center\">\n","  <img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1U52yFSVKvvTwbFi_-phMIR5xYEabNp53' style=\"width: 80vw\"></div>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aNYpL-KmwFG8","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# **Inhibition within a premotor circuit controls the timing of vocal turn-taking in zebra finches.** \n","### Jonathan I. Benichov & Daniela Vallentin\n","> *Nature* **2020**\n","\n","> **ABSTRACT:** Vocal turn-taking is a fundamental organizing principle of human conversation but the neural circuit mechanisms that structure coordinated vocal interactions are unknown. The ability to exchange vocalizations in an alternating fashion is also exhibited by other species, including zebra finches. With a combination of behavioral testing, electrophysiological recordings, and pharmacological manipulations we demonstrate that activity within a cortical premotor nucleus orchestrates the timing of calls in socially interacting zebra finches. Within this circuit, local inhibition precedes premotor neuron activation associated with calling. Blocking inhibition results in faster vocal responses as well as an impaired ability to flexibly avoid overlapping with a partner. These results support a working model in which premotor inhibition regulates context-dependent timing of vocalizations and enables the precise interleaving of vocal signals during turn-taking."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1MegNozwwQWm","colab_type":"code","cellView":"form","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":146},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1596401533149,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":790,"user":{"displayName":"Krista Perks","photoUrl":"","userId":"11118389411424303278"}},"outputId":"f3f65bb8-c979-4725-91aa-bdfd1a3c27da"},"source":["#@title Cartoon of Zebra Finches calling; from Benichov and Vallentin (2020)\n","%%html\n","<div align=\"center\">\n","  <img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HnzkYKkSBqqfHT33LkkIMa7nxN-ykUyA' style=\"width: 30vw\"></div>\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<div align=\"center\">\n","  <img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HnzkYKkSBqqfHT33LkkIMa7nxN-ykUyA' style=\"width: 30vw\"></div>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NRlbvJ8zwFG-","colab_type":"text"},"source":["In preparation for this class, you read these two papers that examine the commuication behavior or vocal turn taking in two different non-human species.
